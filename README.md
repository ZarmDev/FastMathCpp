# FastMathCpp
A program that can parse many layers of parentheses (but ignoring PEMDAS)

Rundown:
- Can do +, -, *, /, %
- Supports decimals and doing operations with decimals
- May have unexpected output with huge numbers (I'm not sure)

Notes:
- In test.cpp, there is code to compare it to c++'s performance with math.
