# FastMathCpp
A program that can parse many layers of parentheses (but ignoring PEMDAS)
Notes:
- It can't handle numbers that are TOO big and might return negative numbers or unexpected output.
- If you want to use this in your own project, just remove the main function and you probably should remove the debug and message variables throughout the code if you don't want it there.
- In test.cpp, there is code to compare it to c++'s performance with math.
